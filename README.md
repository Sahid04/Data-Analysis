# 🧠 Handedness, Age, and Mortality: A Data Science Exploration

This project investigates the relationship between handedness (left- or right-handed), age, and mortality using real-world datasets and Python data science tools. Through data visualization and probabilistic modeling, we explore how the prevalence of left-handedness varies by age and birth cohort, and how this relates to observed differences in age at death.

## 📊 Project Features

- **Data Loading & Visualization:**  
  - Loads and visualizes left-handedness rates by age and gender.
  - Plots the mean percentage of left-handed people by birth year.
  - Loads and visualizes US death distribution data by age.

- **Probabilistic Modeling:**  
  - Implements functions to compute conditional probabilities:
    - Probability of being left-handed given age at death.
    - Probability of dying at a certain age given handedness.
  - Calculates and compares average ages at death for left- and right-handed groups for different study years.

- **Reproducible Analysis:**  
  - All code is provided in a Jupyter Notebook for easy exploration and modification.
